/* You have a collection of N gauntlets, each with a specific color represented by A[i]. 
Your goal is to maximize the number of pairs by repeatedly pairing up gauntlets of the same color.
Determine the maximum number of pairs that can be formed.
Constraints:
----------

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^2
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^3

Calculate Pairs for Each Color:

For color 4: We have 3 gauntlets, so the number of pairs is 3 / 2 = 1. There is 1 leftover gauntlet of color 4 that doesn’t form a pair.
For color 1: We have 2 gauntlets, so the number of pairs is 2 / 2 = 1. There are no leftover gauntlets of color 1.
For color 7: We have 1 gauntlet, so the number of pairs is 1 / 2 = 0. This gauntlet cannot form any pairs.
Sum of Pairs:

Total pairs = 1 (from color 4) + 1 (from color 1) + 0 (from color 7) = 2. */
